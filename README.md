Password strength checker

This application is desigend for user to check weather there existing password is safe enough or not, with the help of philips hue light the user is informed weather they are using strong or weak password.
First is Home, which is an introduction of an app to the user.
Second is Application, where a user enters there password to check weather it is strong enough or not with a help of hue lights.
